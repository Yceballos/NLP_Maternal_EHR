# NLP_Maternal_EHR
Medical text representation methodology based on Deep Learning models with a training layer for the NER task of medical records, in which a text processing and correction stage is integrated. It is expected to improve the performance of the model, avoiding eliminating words outside the dictionary due to errors in the texts and thus hitting a greater percentage of entities that serve as a tool for the prevention of maternal diseases.
